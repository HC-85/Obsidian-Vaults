[[Topological space]] $T$ is separable if there is a countable, dense subset.
That is equivalent to saying that there exists a sequence $\mathsf{S}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow T$: 
$$\mathsf{S} = \{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$$
such that for every open $K\neq\emptyset\subset T$, there exists $x_n\in K$ for some $n$.
### Example 
The real line is separable since $\mathbb{Q}$ are a countable dense subset.

Any topological space that is finite or countably infinite is separable.
