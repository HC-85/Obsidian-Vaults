Expands the correlation function of the n-body system using a [[Multipole Expansion|multipole expansion]] in order to treat sources that are close together as one. 

Interactions between distant basis functions need not have their corresponding matrix elements explicitly stored. If applied in a hierarchical manner, it reduces matrix-vector products to $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

Also applied in:
- [[Hartree-Fock Method|Hartree-Fock]] 
- [[Density Functional Theory]]
