#Pending https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_contact_map
Represents a protein structure as a matrix. 
The $ij$ entry is 1 if the distance between residue $i$ and $j$ goes below certain threshold, else 0.
These are invariant to Euclidean transformations.
May be invertible if precise.

Coevolving features may be analyzed through protein contact maps. These may be found using:
- MSA: [[Multiple sequence alignment]]
- OMES: [[Observed vs expected frequencies of residue pairs]]
- McBASC: [[McLachlan based substitution correlation]]
- [[Statistical coupling analysis]]
- [[Mutual information]] methods
- DCA: Direct coupling analysis
