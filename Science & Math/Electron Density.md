The electron density of an $N$-electron wavefunction $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, s)$ is given by:
$$
\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \Psi|\hat{\rho}(\mathbf{r})|\Psi \rangle
$$
with the operator of the density observable $\hat{\rho}$ is:
$$
\hat{\rho}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$
In [[Hartree-Fock]] and [[Density Functional Theory|density functional]] theories, the wavefunction is represented as a single [[Slater Determinant|Slater determinant]] constructed from $N$ orbitals $\varphi_k$ with corresponding occupations $n_k$:
$$
\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum^N_{k=1}n_k|\varphi_k(\mathbf{r})|^2
$$
