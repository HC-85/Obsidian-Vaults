[[Convex polytope]] whose points are [[Bistochastic Matrix|bistochastic matrices]].
Denoted as $B_n$ for $n\times n$ matrices.
Its extreme points are permutation matrices by the [[Birkhoff-von Neumann Decomposition|Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem]]

Edges are such that its vertices are permutation matrices differing by a single cycle.
The graph of $B_n$ is a [[Cayley Graph|Cayley graph]] of the [[Symmetric Group|symmetric group]] $S_n$.

For any [[bipartite graph]] satisfying [[Hall's Marriage Theorem|Hall's Marriage]] condition, there is a Birkhoff polytope whose extreme points correspond to its perfect [[Matching|matchings]]. That is, it is the perfect [[matching polytope]] of some bipartite graphs
