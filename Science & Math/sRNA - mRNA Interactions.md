RNA polymerase binds to DNA and synthetizes several identical mRNAs (transcription).
Ribosome binds to the mRNA's binding site and proceeds to recruit amino acids to form corresponding protein (translation). 

The efficiency of translation may be affected by several factors. For example, ribonucleases degrade mRNA but an mRNA may interact with itself and its corresponding sRNA to create loops which prevent either ribonucleases or ribosomes from binding to them, exponentiating or halting respectively; 

The presence of sRNAs also affects how translation behaves when they bind to mRNA. In bacteria, these sometimes contain a motif that recruits the HFQ protein, which forms a complex that stabilizes the sRNA-mRNA complex, as well as making its molecules and mRNA's more accessible for interaction.
