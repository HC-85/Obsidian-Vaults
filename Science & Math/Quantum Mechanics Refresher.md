$e^x$ is an eigenfunction of the $\text{d}/\text{d}x$ operator.
$\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are eigenfunctions of the $\text{d}^2/\text{d}x^2$

The eigenfunctions of an operator form a complete set that span the function space.

For degenerate eigenfunctions, that is, those that have repeated eigenvalues, any linear combination of them is also an eigenfunction.

The different representations in quantum mechanics are simply different basis that the vector space can take.

In the position representation:

| |Position representation | Momentum Representation |
|-|-|-|
| $x$ | $x\times$ | $\hbar\partial/i\partial x$ |
| $p_x$ | $-\hbar \partial/i\partial p_x$|$p_x \times$

The non-commutativity of two operators indicates... something something eigenvalues as observables
