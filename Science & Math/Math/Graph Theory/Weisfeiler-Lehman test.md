Approximating permutation invariant functions is closely related to decide whether or not two graphs are isomorphic. (_On the equivalence between graph isomorphism testing and function approximation with gnns_)

There is a trade-off between invariance and expressibility, since the former restricts the functions.

WL-test is an isomorphism test based on color refinement. 

The test fails for two regular graphs with the same number of nodes and same degrees, regardless of connectedness. 

Can be generalized to $k$-WL tests, where one keeps track of $k$ colors. 

The power of these is quite well understood ([[Sherali-Adams linear programming hierarchy]]) (_Descriptive complexity, canonisation, and definable graph structure theory_)

An undirected path has only two automorphisms: the trivial and flipping ends.
The collection of all automorphisms of $G$ form a permutation group.
