Let $G$ be a graph and $V$ its vertices and $\phi :V\rightarrow R$ , where $R$ is a [[ring]]. 
Then, the discrete Laplacian $\Delta$ acting on $\phi$ at a vertex $v$ is:
$$
\Delta \phi (v) = \sum _{\{w| d(v, w) = 1\}}[\phi(v)-\phi(w)]
$$
These may also refer to the Laplacians obtained through [[finite differences]].
