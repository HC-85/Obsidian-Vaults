Is an infinite sequence of terms, where each consists of an element of a [[ring]] multiplied by the power of a formal variable.
$$c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + ...$$
Note that since $x$ is a formal variable, it is not meant to be evaluated, and thus there is no concept of convergence and are simply used for algebraic manipulation.

These find applications in [[generating functions]], solving [[differential equations]], and studying properties of [[algebraic structures]].
