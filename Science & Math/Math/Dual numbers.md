# Abstract definition
Dual numbers are a specific type of either [[Hypercomplex numbers|hypercomplex numbers]] or [[Grassmann numbers]], which in turn can be considered a specific type of a [[Clifford algebra]] or a [[|Grassman algebra]] respectively.

These form a two-dimensional commutative algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. 

They can be defined as the quotient of a polynomial [[Ring|ring]] over $\mathbb{R}$ by the principal ideal generated by the square of the indeterminate (???):
$$
\mathbb{R}[X]/\langle X^2 \rangle
$$
Alternatively, they can be defined as the [[exterior algebra]] of a one-dimensional vector space with $\varepsilon$ as its basis element.

# Intuitive construction
The dual numbers are numbers of the form:
$$
a + b\varepsilon
$$
where $\varepsilon ^2 = 0$.

## Basic calculations
$$
(a + b\varepsilon)(c + d\varepsilon) = ac + (ad + bc)\varepsilon
$$
To find the [[zero divisors]] of the ring means to find $a + b\varepsilon \neq 0$ (or $c + d\varepsilon\neq 0$) such that:
$$
ac + (ad + bc)\varepsilon = 0
$$
If $a=0$, then $c=0$ and vice versa. Thus, the zero divisors of the dual numbers are of the form $b\varepsilon$. 

We can also divide dual numbers as long as the denominator is not a zero divisor:
$$
\frac{a + b\varepsilon}{c + d\varepsilon} = \frac{a + b\varepsilon}{c + d\varepsilon}\frac{a - b\varepsilon}{c - d\varepsilon} = \frac{ac + (bc - ad)\varepsilon}{c^2} 
$$
## Relation with the derivative
Suppose we have a function $f$ with a power series representation:
$$
f(x) = \sum _{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n 
$$
If we take $x = x + \varepsilon$ and use the binomial formula: 
$$
\begin{align}
f(x+\varepsilon) &= \sum _{n=0}^\infty a_n(x+\varepsilon)^n\\
&=\sum _{n=0}^\infty\sum _{k=0}^\infty a_n\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}\varepsilon ^k
\end{align}
$$
Since $\varepsilon ^k = 0$ for $k>1$:
$$
\begin{align}
f(x+\varepsilon) &= \sum _{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n + \varepsilon\sum _{n=0}^\infty na_nx^{n-1} \\
&=f(x) + \varepsilon f^\prime(x)
\end{align}
$$
Rearranging we can get a very familiar expression:
$$
\varepsilon f^\prime (x) = f(x+\varepsilon) - f(x)
$$
Notice we cannot divide by $\varepsilon$ since it is a zero divisor. 

### Viewed as polynumbers

## Matrix representation
Dual numbers $a + b\varepsilon$ can be represented by matrix:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
a & b\\ 
0 & a \\ 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
