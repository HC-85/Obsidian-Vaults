Let $M$ be a [[Hermitian Matrix|Hermitian matrix]] and $\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{C}^n\backslash \{0\}$.
Then $M$ is positive-definite if:$$\mathbf{z}^*M\mathbf{z}>0$$Then $M$ is positive semi-definite if:$$\mathbf{z}^*M\mathbf{z}\geq0$$
And similarly for negative and semi negative-definite.

Alternatively, $M$ is positive-definite iff any of the following hold:
- It is the matrix of a [[Definite Quadratic Form|definite quadratic form]] or [[Hermitian Form|Hermitian form]].
- It defines an [[Inner Product|inner product]].
- $M$ is congruent with a diagonal and positive matrix $A$: $M=P^\top AP$
- $M$ is Hermitian and all eigenvalues are real and positive.

Positive and semi positive-definite matrices form open and closed [[Convex Cone|convex cones]].
