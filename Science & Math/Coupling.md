Allows for the comparison of unrelated random variables.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[Random Variable|random variables]], then their coupling is a new probability space with random variables $X^\prime$ and $Y^\prime$ having the same distribution as $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
That is, we create a [[Random Vector|random vector]] whose [[Marginal Probability Distribution|marginal distributions]] correspond to $X$ and $Y$.
