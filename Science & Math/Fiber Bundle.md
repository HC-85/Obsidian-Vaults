Space that behaves locally as a [[Product Space|product space]], but may have a different global [[Topological Space|topological structure]].

## Definition
Structure $(E,B,\pi, F)$, where $E,B$ and $F$ are topological spaces and $\pi:E\rightarrow B$ is a continuous surjection satisfying local triviality that we call bundle projection.
- $E$ is the total space
- $B$ is the base space
- $F$ is the fiber

Let $B$ be connected and that for every $x\in B$, there is a neighborhood $U$ with a homeomorphism $\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$ such that the diagram commutes:

Here, $\text{proj}_1$ is the natural projection.
The set of all $\{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}$ is called a local trivialization of the bundle.
