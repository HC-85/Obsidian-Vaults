AKA spectrum
Subset of the domain of a real-valued function $f$ that does not map to zero.
If the domain of $f$ is a topological space, the support is the smallest closed set of all points not mapped to zero.

Is a notion of where a measure lives in the [[Measurable Space|measurable]] [[Topological Space|topological space]].

Let:
- ($X$, $\tau$) be a topological space
- $B(T)$ the [[Borel Algebra|Borel]] $\sigma$[[Sigma Algebra|-algebra]] on $X$ 
- $\mu$ be a [[Measure|measure]] on ($X$, $\tau$)
The support of $\mu$ is the set of all points $x\in X$ for which $\forall N_x \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, $\mu (N_x)\geq 0$
