Also called a probability triple ($\Omega$, $\mathcal{F}$, $P$):
- $\Omega$: set of possible outcomes (sample space).
- $\mathcal{F}$: set of events, which- are sets of outcomes. (Typically a $\sigma$[[Sigma Algebra|-algebra]] for continuous $\mathcal{F}$)
- $P$: probability function.

Often arises from a [[Measureable Space|measurable space]] + probability function.
