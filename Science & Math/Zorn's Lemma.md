AKA Kuratowskiâ€“Zorn lemma

A [[Partial Order|partially ordered set]] containing upper bounds for every [[Chain (Sets)|chain]] necessarily contains at least one maximal element.

Leads to: 
- [[Hahn-Banach Theorem]]
- [[Tychonoff's Theorem]]
- Every vector space has a basis
- Every product of [[Compact Space|compact spaces]] is compact
- In a [[Ring|ring]] with identity, every [[Proper Ideal|proper]] [[Ideal|ideal]] is contained in a [[Maximal Ideal|maximal ideal]]
- Every [[Field|field]] has an [[Algebraic Closure|algebraic closure]]

Equivalent to the [[Well-Ordering Theorem|well-ordering theorem]] or [[Axiom of Choice|axiom of choice]] within [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]].
