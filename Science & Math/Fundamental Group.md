It is the first [[Homotopy Group|homotopy group]].
Algebraic invariant that associates a group to a topological space.
Captures properties of the space by studying loops and paths. 

Let $X$ be a topological space, then we denote its fundamental group as $\pi_1(X)$. 

We must define a basepoint $x_0$, through which our loops must go. The choice for the basepoint leads to different but naturally isomorphic groups. 

The group elements are all the [[homotopy classes]] of loops based as $x_0$. Two loops are considered in the same homotopy class if they can be deformed into one another while keeping the basepoint fixed. 

The group operation is loop concatenation. The resulting loop is allowed to have self-intersections (???).
