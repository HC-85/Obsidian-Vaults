AKA Doubly Stochastic Matrix
[[Stochastic matrix]] that is both left and right stochastic.

The class of $n\times n$ bistochastic matrices forms a [[Convex Polytope|convex polytope]] called [[Birkhoff Polytope|Birkhoff polytope]] $B_n$, which has an embedding on a $(n-1)^2$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. 

Any bistochastic matrix can be represented by a convex combination of permutation matrices.
