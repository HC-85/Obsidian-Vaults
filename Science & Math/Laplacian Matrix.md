AKA graph Laplacian, admittance matrix, Kirchhoff matrix, discrete Laplacian.

Matrix representation of a matrix. Equivalent to the matrix form of the negative [[Discrete Laplacian Operator|discrete Laplacian operator]].

The Laplacian matrix of a graph $G$, is simply its degree matrix minus its adjacency matrix.
The degree matrix, is a diagonal matrix that contains the degree, (number of connected edges) for every node on $G$.
The adjacency matrix $A$ is 1 in $A_{i, j}$ when $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent and 0 otherwise.
