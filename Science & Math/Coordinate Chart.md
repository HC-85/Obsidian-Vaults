Euclidean neighborhoods are always open sets.
If these are homeomorphic to open balls in $\mathbb{R}^n$ they are called Euclidean balls. These form a basis for the topology of a locally Euclidean space.
For any Euclidean neighborhood $U$, a coordinate chart on $U$ is a homeomorphism:
$$
\phi:U\rightarrow\phi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n
$$
An atlas is set of Euclidean neighborhoods along with their coordinate charts such that they cover $M$. 
For two charts $(U, \varphi)$ and $(V, \phi)$ with overlapping domains, the transition function is:
$$
\varphi\circ\phi^{-1}: \phi(U\cap V)\rightarrow \varphi (U\cap V) 
$$
