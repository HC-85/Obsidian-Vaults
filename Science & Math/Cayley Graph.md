See: [[Cayley's Theorem]]

Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and $S$ be a [[Generating Set|generating set]] of $G$.
Identify each element $g\in G$ as a vertex and $s\in S$ as a color $c_s$.
Then, the Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,S)$ is such that there is a directed edge of color $c_s$ from $g$ to $gs$ for all $g\in G$ and $s\in S$.
