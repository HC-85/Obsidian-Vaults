See: [[Projective Geometry]]
Finite arrangement of points and lines such that the [[Incidence|incidence]] of every line is the same as well as the incidence of every point is the same.

We denote the configuration with $p$ points having $\gamma$ incident lines and $\ell$ lines having $\pi$ incident points by $(p_\gamma, \ell_\pi)$. 
This pair does not uniquely identify the configuration's [[Incidence Structure|incidence structure]].
