Gives the conditions under which a strictly positive probability distribution can be represented as events generated by a [[Markov Random Field|Markov random field]].

It states that a strictly positive distribution satisfies one of the Markov properties wrt an undirected graph iff it is a [[Gibbs Random Field|Gibbs random field]], that is, its density can be factorized over the cliques of the graph.
