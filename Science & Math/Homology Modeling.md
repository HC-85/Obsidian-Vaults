Also known as comparative modeling.
Constructs a model of the target protein from its sequence and an experimental 3D structure of a homologous protein (template).
Based on the fact that protein structure is more conserved than sequence similarity. 
Poor alignment leads to poor performance. Loop regions are the least accurate ([[Loop modeling]]).
