Decomposes a square matrix $A$ into rotation/reflection given by a [[Unitary Matrix|unitary matrix]] $U$ and a scaling along orthogonal axes given by a [[Definite Matrix|positive semi-definite]] [[Hermitian Matrix|Hermitian]] matrix $P$:$$
A = UP
$$If $A$ is invertible, the decomposition is unique, $P$ will be [[Definite Matrix|positive definite]], and we can write:$$
A=Ue^X
$$for Hermitian $X$. See: [[Fundamental Group]], [[Lie Group]]
