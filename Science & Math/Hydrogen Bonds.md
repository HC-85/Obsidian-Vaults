See: [[Hydrogen Bond Plot]]
Primary electrostatic force between a hydrogen covalently bound to more electronegative donor and another electronegative acceptor with a lone pair of electrons: Dn-H...Ac

The energy can vary from 1 to 40 kcal/mol.
Stronger than van der Waals but weaker than fully covalent or ionic bonds.
