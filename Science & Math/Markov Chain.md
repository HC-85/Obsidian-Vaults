An $(S,\Sigma)$-measurable [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] $({X_t})_{t\in T}$ with a [[Total Order|totally ordered]] [[index set]] $T$ that is [[Adapted Process|adapted]] to a [[filtration]] $(\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\in T}$ such that $\forall A\in\Sigma$ and $s,t\in T$ with $s<t$:
$$
P(X_t\in A|\mathcal{F}_s) = P(X_t\in A|X_s)
$$

Often described in terms of a directed graph and a [[Stochastic Matrix|stochastic matrix]].
