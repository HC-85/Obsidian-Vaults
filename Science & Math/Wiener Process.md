See: [[Levy Process|Levy process]].
Real valued continuous-time [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]].
Sometimes called Brownian motion.

A Wiener process $W_t$ is such that:
- $W_0 = 0$ almost surely
- $W$ has independent increments, that is, future increments are independent of past values
- $W$ has Gaussian increments, $W_{t+u}-W_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,u)$
- $Wt$ is almost surely continuous in $t$.

Alternatively, an almost surely continuous [[Martingale|martingale]] with $W_0=0$ and [[Quadratic Variation|quadratic variation]] $[W_t,W_t]=t$
