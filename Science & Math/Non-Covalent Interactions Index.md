Visualization index based on electron density and [[Reduced Density Gradient|reduced density gradient]].
Non-covalent interactions can be associated with regions of small reduced density gradient and low electronic densities.

It is depicted as an isosurface for the reduced density gradient and colored by the product of the electron density and the second eigenvalue of the Hessian ($\lambda_H$, whose sign determines charge character)

Invariant with respect to the transformation of molecular orbitals.
