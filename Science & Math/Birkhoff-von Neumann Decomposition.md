The since the [[Birkhoff polytope]] $B_n$ is the [[Convex Hull|convex hull]] of the set of $n\times n$ permutation matrices, we can decompose any [[bistochastic matrix]] as a convex combination of these.

Not unique.

Real-valued generalization of [[Kőnig's Theorem|Kőnig's theorem]] if [[Adjacency Matrix|adjacency matrices]] are used.

Finding the decomposition with minimal terms is [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]].
