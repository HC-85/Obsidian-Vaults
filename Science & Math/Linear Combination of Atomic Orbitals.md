Technique for calculating molecular orbitals.

It is assumed that the number of molecular orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals in the linear expansion. The $i$-th molecular orbital is then:
$$
\phi_i = \sum_{r=1}^n c_{ri}\chi _r
$$
With $i \in \{1, ... n\}$ 
The coefficients of the expansion can be obtained using the [[Hartree-Fock Method|Hartree-Fock method]]
