AKA transition matrix
Describes transitions of a [[Markov chain]].
The $(i,j)$-element is the probability to transition from $i$ to $j$.

"Right" prefix indicates each row is a [[Stochastic Vector|stochastic vector]].
"Left" prefix indicates each column is a [[Stochastic Vector|stochastic vector]].

If each row and each column sum to one, then it is a [[Bistochastic Matrix|bistochastic matrix]].

Its eigenvectors are also called stationary stochastic vectors or [[Stationary Distribution|stationary distributions]].
