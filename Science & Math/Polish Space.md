[[Separable Space]], [[Completely Metrizable Space|completely metrizable]], [[topological space]].
Homeomorphic to a complete metric space with a countable, dense subset.

Primary setting for [[Descriptive Set Theory|descriptive set theory]] and advanced topics in [[measure theory]] such as [[probability theory]].

There is a [[Borel Isomorphism|Borel isomorphism]] between any two uncountable Polish spaces.
Every uncountable Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.

### Properties
- Second countable.
- Any $G_{\delta}$[[G Delta Set|-subset]] is also a Polish space.
