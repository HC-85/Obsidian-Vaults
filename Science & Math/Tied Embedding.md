Weight sharing between embedding layer and output dense layer.
Benefits:
- Helps leverage pre-trained embeddings for transfer learning effectively
- Regularizes by forcing a more general representation
- Improves interpretability and coherence since we can analyze how specific features are utilized across the network.
