Stochastic [[Ising Model|Ising model]].
A type of [[Energy-based Models|energy-based model]] and also a [[Markov Random Field|Markov random field]].

The global energy $E$ is identical to that of a [[Hopfield Network|Hopfield network]] and [[Ising Model|Ising model]]:
$$
E = -\left(\sum_{i<j}w_{ij}s_is_j+\sum_{i}\theta_is_i\right)
$$
for connection strength $w_{ij}$ between states $s_i,s_j\in\{0,1\}$ of units $i$ and $j$ with bias $\theta_i$.
