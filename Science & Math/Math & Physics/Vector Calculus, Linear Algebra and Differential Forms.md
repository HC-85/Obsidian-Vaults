Points are to be denoted as $\mathbf{x} = \left(\matrix{x_1\\ x_2\\ ...}\right )$ and vectors as $\vec{\mathbf{x}} = \left[\matrix{x_1\\ x_2\\ ...}\right ]$
Important to note that points may only be substracted, not added (how do you stablish the correct relation with affine spaces?), and these result in vectors.
Vectors as increments to points.

A vector field is a function $\vec{F}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$
