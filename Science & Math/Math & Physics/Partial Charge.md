Created due to the asymmetric distribution of electrons in chemical bonds.
Property only for zones within a distribution, not as a whole. 
Denoted $\delta-$ and $\delta +$ 

These are used in molecular mechanics [[Force Fields|force fields]] to compute electrostatic interactions.
Partial atomic charges can be determined using the extended Born thermodynamic cycle, including an analysis of covalent and ionic bonding contributions.
