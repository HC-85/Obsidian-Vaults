AKA general topology.
Deals with set-theoretic definitions and constructions in topology. 

Let $X$ be a set and let $\tau$ be a collection of sets of $X$.
If:
- $\emptyset, X \in \tau$.
- $\tau$ is closed under union.
- $\tau$ is closed under finite intersections. 
Then $\tau$ is a topology in $X$.

The pair ($X$, $\tau$) is a [[Topological Space|topological space]].
