Any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets through:
- Relative complementation
- Countable union
- Countable intersection

The collection of Borel sets on a topological space $X$ forms a $\sigma$[[Sigma Algebra|-algebra]], the [[Borel Algebra|Borel algebra]], which is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all open sets.
