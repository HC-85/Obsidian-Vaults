A $\sigma$-algebra on a set $E$ is a nonempty collection $\Sigma$ of subsets on $E$ closed under:
- Complement
- Countable unions
- Countable intersections
The ordered pair ($E$, $\Sigma$) is called a [[Measureable Space|measurable space]].

Prevents the Banach-Tarski paradox by constraining the types of sets that can be used in measure theory.
