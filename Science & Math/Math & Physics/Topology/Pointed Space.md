Topological space with a basepoint. 
Maps of pointed spaces must preserve the basepoint. 

Special case in [[relative topology]].

## In category theory
The [[Math & Physics/Set Theory/Class|class]] of all pointed spaces forms a category $\mathbf{Top}_{\{\bullet\}}$ with basepoint-preserving continuous maps $\{\bullet\}\rightarrow X$ as morphisms. 

Can also be seen as a [[comma category]] ($\{\bullet\} \downarrow \mathbf{Top}$), where $\{\bullet\}$ is any one point space and $\mathbf{Top}$ is the [[category of topological spaces]]. This is also called a [[coslice category]] denoted $\{\bullet\}/\mathbf{Top}$. 

$\{\bullet\}$ is a [[zero object]] in $\mathbf{Top}_{\{\bullet\}}$ and a [[terminal object]] in $\mathbf{Top}$. 

There is a [[forgetful functor]] $\mathbf{Top}_{\{\bullet\}}\rightarrow \mathbf{Top}$.
