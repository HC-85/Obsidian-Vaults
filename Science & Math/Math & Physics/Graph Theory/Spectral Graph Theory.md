# Ch1: Eigenvalues and the Laplacian of a graph
Attempts to describe the main properties of a graph in terms of its graph spectrum.
There is an analogy between spectral graph theory and [[spectral Riemmanian geometry]]

We can define the Laplacian $\mathcal{L}(u, v)$ of a graph $G$ as:
	If $u=v$ and $d_v\neq 0$: 1
	If $u$ is adjacent to $v$ ($u \sim v$): $-1/\sqrt{d_ud_v}$
	Else: 0
Or: 
$$
\mathcal{L} = D^{-1/2}LD^{-1/2}
$$where $L$ is the [[Laplacian matrix]] and $D$ the degree matrix.
