For continuous [[Random Variable|random variables]], the conditional probability density function of $Y$ given $x\in X$:
$$
f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f_{X, Y}(x, y)}{f_X(x)}
$$
where $f_{X, Y}$ is the [[Joint Probability Distribution|joint probability distribution]] and $f_X$ is the [[Marginal Probability Distribution|marginal probability distribution]].

Check [[Borel-Kolmogorov Paradox]]

Contrasts with marginal distribution, which doesn't reference the value of the variable.
