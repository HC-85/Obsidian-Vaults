Inverse of the dissociation constant.
Special case of the equilibrium constant $K$.
The reaction is balanced when:
$$
k_{on} [R][L] = k_{off}[RL]
$$
Where $R$ stands for receptor, $L$ for ligand, and $RL$ for its complex.
Thus, 
$$
K_a = \frac{k_{on}}{k_{off}} = \frac{[RL]}{[R][L]}
$$
The molar [[Gibbs Free Energy|Gibbs free energy]], or binding affinity, is related as:
$$
\Delta G = -RT\ln(K_ac^{\theta})
$$
