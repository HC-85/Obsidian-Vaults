$$
dX_t=a(X_i, t)dt+b(X_t,t)dW_t
$$
- $X_t$ is the state [[Random Variable|variable]] at time $t$
- $a(X_t, t)$ is a deterministic function often called drift term.
- $b(X_t, t)$ is a diffusion term. Intensity of the random fluctuations.
- $dW_t$ is an increment in the [[Wiener process]]. Random noise.

A simple example is [[Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)]].
