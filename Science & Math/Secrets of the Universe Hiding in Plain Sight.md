Universe is simple at cosmological scales.
Look in the right places, we have more then enough data from the cosmos.

Quantum mechanics prevents light waves from reaching arbitrarily small wavelengths.

CMB appears as a random wave pattern. Nonetheless, the spectrum of the waves is very precise.

The polarization of light coming from the big bang is a parameter-free prediction, besides cosmological constants.

The proposed model Lambda-CDM has only 5 fundamental parameters:
- Matter/Energy
	- Cosmological constant $\Lambda$
	- Dark matter
	- Nucleons
- Primordial Density Waves
	- Amplitude: $10^{-5}$ (Fluctuations in the CMB)
	- "Red tilt": $0.04$ (Longer waves are stronger)

Red tilt suggests critical behavior and is thought to hold for most if not all scales. 

It is impossible to create a wave that moves in a single direction using a stick on a pond. One must use an infinite 1D front, like a very long stick sideways, otherwise at the ends there's diffraction. Illustrates the uncertainty principle.

The plank length is such that if you were to use light with the wavelengths to see at this resolution, this would create a blackhole due to gravity: $\approx 10^{-35}$ m.
On the other hand, the Lambda horizon is the opposite, caused by the repulsive gravity of $\Lambda$: $\approx 10^{30}$ m.

All known physics so far:
$$

 = \int e^{\huge\frac{i}{h}\int\left(\frac{R}{16 \pi G}-\frac{1}{4}F^2+\overline{\psi}i\cancel{D}\psi - \lambda H \overline{\psi}\psi + |DH|^2-V(H)\right)}
$$
Gravity, forces, particles + 3 Higgs
Particles + connections

Three generations of Leptons and Quarks.
We've only observed left-handed neutrinos $\nu_L$.
It is proposed that right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ exist but they are very heavy. 
$\nu_L$ couple to the Higgs and transmute to $\nu_R$ and then back to $\nu_L$. 
These are virtual since they only exist briefly, for a time inversely proportional to the mass of $\nu_R$ , explaining why we haven't seen them.
If we assume the universe is CPT invariant, $\nu_R$ can explain dark matter as Hawking radiation from the big bang. 
The needed mass for $\nu_R$ is $5\times 10^8$ $m_p$ 
At the big bang, the universe shrinks linearly, which allows for analytic continuation. The big bang as a CPT mirror. Like a method of images.
The theory predicts that:
$$
\text{Stability of one $\nu_R$}\implies \text{one massless } \nu_L
$$
This is since there would be no coupling to the Higgs.
Can somehow be calculated by measuring the clustering of galaxies.

Big bang is conformal, that is, only preserves angles, not sizes. Thus light would not even be aware of a singularity.

The simplicity of the large-scale geometry of the universe can be explained thermodynamically.
